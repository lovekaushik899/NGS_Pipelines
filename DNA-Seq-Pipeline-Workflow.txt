|	| 5. BWA	| Alignment of reads to the reference genome		| conda install -c bioconda hisat2		|								|

|	NOTE:																							| 
|		It is advised that the user sets up separate environment for each of the tool, so that dependencies and packages of one tool will not interfere with those of others		|
|		Before execution this pipeline, we have the genome already indexed with us. Genome indexing was done using HiSAT2								|
|		Command for creationof separate environment and installation is:														|
|			conda create -n env_name -c bioconda tool_name																|
|				# create: For creation of environent																|
|				# -n: This flag specifies new																	|
|				# env_name: Users can decide the name of the environment being created as per their wish									|
|				# -c: This flag specifies the channel																|
|				# bioconda: Name of the channel																	|
|				# tool_name: Tool that is to be downloaded															|
|																								|
|	STEPS OF THE PIPELINE																					|
|		1. Run the quality check on the raw reads using FastQC and MultiQC														|
|		2. Trimming of quality-checked raw reads using trim galore															|
|		3. Second round of quality check on trimmed reads																|
|		4. Alignement of quality-checked trimmed reads against the reference genome using BWA												|
|		5. Once the alignment has been done, the generated (.sam) files will then be converted to (.bam) files										|
|		6. These (.bam) files will then be sorted and then indexed															|
